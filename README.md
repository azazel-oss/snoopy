# Snoopy

## Description

Snoopy is a chatting webapp which uses next-js as its core framework. You can create your own profile, add new contacts, register yourself. For the database I am using the inbuilt vercel/postgres database, and tailwind for styling. This project also uses typescript for better type checking and consistency. This app also uses next-auth@beta for managing user auth.

## Motivation

This app serves its only purpose which is privacy, which comes in the form of not many people knowing about the app. And it stays in the browser, no mobile app so you don't have to worry about someone checking your phone and reading your chats ;)

## Getting Started

Add the environment details in a new file `.env.local`
To run the development server, install pnpm and run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome but only after I get a job.
